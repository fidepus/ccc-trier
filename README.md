Android App of the [Chaos Computer Club Trier](http://c3t.de). Does all sorts of cool things like showing the clubstatus, pushing it to you via C2DM, show news and location. Additional points for pure style and because we can.

Who?

Initial work by the peeps at the [Android Geekend](https://ccc-trier.de/wiki/Geekend/Android), main additional work by [@Ranlvor](https://twitter.com/#!/ranlvor) with some ideas and a lot of pushing around by me ([@fidepus](https://twitter.com/#!/fidepus)).
